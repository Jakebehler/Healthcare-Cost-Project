## Project Goal: 
To conduct an end-to-end quantitative analysis on U.S. medical insurance data (1,300+ records) to identify and quantify the primary demographic and behavioral factors driving patient charges.

## Methodology: 
Implemented Multiple Linear Regression (R² = 0.751) after extensive EDA and feature engineering in Python/R. The model was built to statistically assess the individual impact of variables like age, BMI, and location on total medical costs.

## Key Finding: 
The analysis proved that smoking is the single most significant cost driver, increasing predicted charges by approximately $23,000 per patient, providing crucial statistical evidence for risk assessment and policy design within insurance modeling.

## Business Value: 
The final insights and Tableau visualizations were designed to inform actuaries and risk management teams on key variables for pricing and cost mitigation strategies.
